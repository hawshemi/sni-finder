## Features

| Feature                | Description                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **TLS 1.3 and HTTP/2** | Scans for domains supporting TLS 1.3 and HTTP/2 to identify modern, secure configurations. |
| **TLS Ping Display**   | Shows TLS Ping results for the scanned domains, helping assess response times. |
| **Top 5 Servers**      | Outputs the top 5 servers based on the lowest ping values, useful for prioritizing fast servers. |

### Output Files
- `results.txt`: Contains the detailed scan log.
- `domains.txt`: Contains only the discovered domain names.

> **Note:** It is recommended to run this scanner locally _(with your residential internet)_. Running a scanner in the cloud may cause VPS providers to flag your account.

## Installation

Download the appropriate binary for your system architecture (`amd64` or `arm64`).

## Usage

### Run on Linux/Mac OS:

1. Download and set up the binary:
    ```bash
    wget "https://github.com/hawshemi/SNI-Finder/releases/latest/download/SNI-Finder-$(uname -s | tr A-Z a-z)-amd64" -O SNI-Finder && chmod +x SNI-Finder
    ```
2. Run the scanner:
    ```bash
    ./SNI-Finder -addr <ip-address>
    ```

### Run on Windows:

1. Download the binary from [Releases](https://github.com/hawshemi/SNI-Finder/releases/latest).
2. Open `CMD` or `Powershell` in the download directory.
3. Run the scanner:
    ```cmd
    .\SNI-Finder-windows-amd64.exe -addr <ip-address>
    ```

> Replace `<ip-address>` with the IP address range you want to scan.
